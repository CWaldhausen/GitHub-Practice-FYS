# GitHub Pages Assignment

Assignment (10 pts):

    - [repo] >> settings >> [scroll to bottom] >> create website from master branch  
    - choose a style  
    - note the website url  
    - you can add your own content if you like, but it's fine to just use the filler content provided

            - click green button "Propose file change" & start pull request
